Rustic is a backup tool that provides fast, encrypted, deduplicated backups.
It reads and writes the [restic][1] repo format desribed in the [design document][2]
and can therefore be used as a complete replacement for restic.

Note that rustic currently is in an beta release and misses tests.
It is not yet considered to be ready for use in a production environment.

## Are binaries available?
Sure. Check out the [releases](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/releases).

## Comparison with restic:

Improvements:
 * Allows using cold storage (e.g. AWS Glacier) repos which are only read in the `restore` command + supports warm-up
 * Completely lock-free pruning; option `instant-delete` is available
 * Supports configuration in a config file ([example config files](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/tree/main/examples))
 * Huge decrease in memory requirement
 * Already faster than restic for most operations (but not yet fully speed optimized)
 * Cleaner concent of logging output; posibility to write logs to a log file
 * `backup` command can use `.gitignore` files
 * `restore` uses existing files; also option `--delete` available
 * Snapshots save much more information, available in `snapshots` command
 * Allows to save some options in the config file via the command `config`
 * New command `repo-info`
 * `check` command checks and uses cache; option `--trust-cache` is available
 * Option `prune --fast-repack` for faster repacking
 * Syntax `<SNAPSHOT>[:PATH]` is available for many commands
 
Current limitations:
 * Runs so far only on Linux and MacOS, Windows support is WIP
 
## Open points:
 * [ ] Add tests and benchmarks
 * [ ] Add missing commands: copy, dump, find, mount
 * [ ] Improve error handling
 * [ ] Parallelize the code even more and optimize for speed where useful
