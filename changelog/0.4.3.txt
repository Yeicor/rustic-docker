Changes in version 0.4.3:

Bugs fixed:
- A bug in `prune` could lead to removal of needed data in the case of duplicate blobs within one pack. This is fixed.
- An inaccuracy in the packer could lead to identical blobs saved within the same pack. This is fixed.
- check: Reported errors when the cache contained more pack files than the repository. This is fixed.
- password-command didn't work correctly when calling a shell with an argument. This is fixed.

New features:
- warm-up options can now be configured in the config file.
- repair index: Added better debug output and error handling.
- Added better error handling when opening a repository.
- Improved allocations when parsing/printing ids.
